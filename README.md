## üìà How It Works

### Workflow and Data Flow

1. **User Input Collection**:
   - Users complete a detailed financial profile form in the sidebar
   - Information collected includes age, income, investment amount, investment horizon, risk comfort level, loss reaction, investment knowledge, financial situation (emergency fund, debt), and investment goals
   - Optional sector exclusions and custom preferences can be specified

2. **Risk Profile Assessment**:
   - The RiskProfiler calculates a risk score (0-100) based on weighted questionnaire responses
   - Risk scores are mapped to three profiles: conservative (<35), moderate (35-65), or aggressive (>65)
   - Age-based recommendations are generated independently for comparison
   - The system evaluates special financial situations (high debt, missing emergency fund)

3. **Portfolio Generation**:
   - The PortfolioGenerator creates an initial asset allocation based on the determined risk profile
   - Asset classes like US Large Cap, US Bonds, International Developed, etc. are assigned percentage allocations
   - Specific tickers are selected for each asset class based on performance data or random selection if data is unavailable
   - The portfolio is enhanced with actual market data including returns, volatility, and key statistics

4. **Market Analysis**:
   - Current market news is retrieved using yfinance (with fallback to general news if unavailable)
   - The SentimentAnalyzer evaluates news sentiment using the FinBERT model
   - A market sentiment summary is generated with positive/neutral/negative classification

5. **Investment Rationale Creation**:
   - The TextGenerator creates a detailed investment rationale using Gemma or template-based generation
   - Explanations are customized to the user's risk profile, investment horizon, and market sentiment
   - Detailed rationales for each asset class are provided

6. **Visualization and Performance Analysis**:
   - Interactive visualizations show portfolio allocation and sector breakdown
   - Historical performance is compared to market benchmarks (S&P 500, Bonds)
   - Risk metrics and correlation analysis highlight diversification benefits
   - Return metrics are calculated from actual market data

7. **Rebalancing Recommendations**:
   - Comparison between recommended portfolio and age-based suggestions
   - Specific rebalancing actions with target percentages for each asset class
   - Threshold-based recommendations (for differences >5%)

## üîç Technical Implementation

### Data Retrieval and Processing

The application uses Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) as the primary data source for real-time and historical market data, offering:

- **Free access** to extensive market data without API keys or rate limits
- **Broad coverage** of stocks, ETFs, indices, and other securities worldwide
- **Rich data points** including OHLC pricing, volume, dividends, fundamental data, and news
- **Historical data** with adjustable time periods for performance analysis

For fundamental data, the application optionally uses the Financial Modeling Prep API, which provides:

- Company profiles and sector classifications
- Financial ratios (P/E, P/B, debt-to-equity, etc.)
- Income statements and balance sheets
- News sentiment aggregation

Data processing involves several sophisticated techniques:

- **Robust error handling**: All data retrieval functions implement comprehensive error handling to manage API failures or missing data
- **Normalization**: Data from different sources is standardized for consistent analysis
- **Correlation analysis**: Asset relationships are analyzed using robust statistical methods
- **Performance calculation**: Returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns are computed using industry-standard approaches

### Machine Learning Models

The application leverages several machine learning models:

1. **Sentiment Analysis (SentimentAnalyzer)**:
   - Uses FinBERT, a BERT model fine-tuned on financial text
   - Pre-trained on financial news and reports for domain-specific understanding
   - Classifies text as positive, neutral, or negative with confidence scores
   - Lazy loading implementation to reduce memory usage until needed
   - Fallback to simpler sentiment model if FinBERT fails to load

2. **Text Generation (TextGenerator)**:
   - Implements Google's Gemma 1B parameter model
   - 8-bit quantization for efficient memory usage on consumer hardware
   - Template-based fallbacks for reliability and consistency
   - Context-aware rationales that incorporate user profile and market data

3. **Portfolio Optimization (PortfolioOptimizer)**:
   - Implements mean-variance optimization from modern portfolio theory
   - Uses Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage for robust covariance estimation
   - Incorporates constraints like maximum allocation per asset
   - Optimizes for risk-adjusted returns based on user risk profile
   - Includes practical constraints like no-short-selling and diversification requirements

### Risk Profiling System

The risk profiling system implements a multi-dimensional assessment with weighted factors:

- **Investment Timeline (15%)**: Measures the user's time horizon (1-3 years to 10+ years)
- **Risk Comfort (25%)**: Assesses subjective comfort with volatility (very low to very high)
- **Loss Reaction (20%)**: Evaluates behavioral response to market downturns (sell all to buy significantly more)
- **Investment Goal (15%)**: Determines primary financial objectives (capital preservation to aggressive growth)
- **Income Stability (10%)**: Considers stability of income sources (unstable to extremely stable)
- **Investment Knowledge (15%)**: Accounts for financial literacy level (none to expert)

These dimensions are combined into a comprehensive risk score (0-100), which maps to:
- **Conservative**: Scores < 35
- **Moderate**: Scores 35-65
- **Aggressive**: Scores > 65

Age-based suggestions provide an additional reference point, with recommended stock/bond allocations adjusted by life stage.

### Portfolio Construction

Portfolio construction follows a hierarchical approach:

1. **Asset Class Allocation**:
   - Conservative profile focuses on bonds (60%), large caps (15%), with minimal exposure to higher-risk assets
   - Moderate profile balances stocks (50% total across market caps) with bonds (30%)
   - Aggressive profile emphasizes stocks (80% total) with minimal bond allocation (5%)
   - Additional asset classes like Real Estate, Commodities, and Cash are incorporated based on risk profile

2. **Ticker Selection**:
   - Specific securities are selected to represent each asset class
   - When market data is available, selections are based on performance metrics
   - Sector restrictions are applied based on user preferences
   - Equal weighting within asset classes for simplicity and diversification

3. **Portfolio Enhancement**:
   - Live market data is incorporated for all selected securities
   - Historical performance is calculated using actual price data
   - Risk metrics like volatility, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown are computed
   - Correlation analysis highlights diversification benefits
